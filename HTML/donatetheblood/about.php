			Blood is the main reason we all are alive; the blood (RBC) carries oxygen from the lungs to all the parts of our body. The moment this process is hampered, a person’s life is in danger. That’s why during many accident cases, the victim dies due to excessive blood loss or brain haemorrhage.
			That’s why sometimes you’ll notice that the hospital is asking the family of the patient to collect blood. If the proper amount of blood isn’t given to the patient’s body, then they might die. So people who donate blood not only do noble work but also save a person’s life when it’s needed.

			As being a human, we must donate blood to save others life. Through blood donation, we can help various needy people and save their precious life. Blood can be regenerated itself in the body and fulfill its amount, once it is donated but life cannot be got back, once it is gone.
			Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.

			Blood donation refers to the process of transfusing blood from a healthy donor to a recipient in need. This process is carried out under the supervision of medical experts. Blood is an essential fluid that flows in our body and keeps our body properly functioning. Blood is transfused to people who lost excessive blood in accidents or due to severe health issues. It is usually collected from a family member or a healthy donor who is willing to donate. There are four blood groups in humans which are A, B, O, and AB. The people with blood group AB are called universal recipients and with O are referred to as universal donors. Blood Banks
